# Communication Protocols

These are the various methods of accessing Josh Cox.

{% method %}
## [Human Interaction](./human.md)

Human Interaction is for pleasantries, don't get me wrong I love
hearing about whatever cool thing you discovered recently. However, if what we are
going to be talking about pertains to work to be done it might be more
appropriate to create an issue using the [jira](./jira.md) method.  Also, if I am wearing
headphones it is greatly preferred that you try one of the other methods
instead.

## [Slack](./slack.md)

Slack is the go to method for quick communication.

## [Jira](./jira.md)

Jira issues are the staple workhorse of our company

## [Github issue](./github.md)

Github issues are public, and you might consider putting this issue in
Jira before airing our laundry publicly.  Other than that github issues
should be directly applicable to a bug of some sort. Assign it to me and
you might ping me in slack with a link to the issue upon creation.

## [Email](./email.md)

E-mail is the go to method for asynchronous quick offline communication.
Offline and asynchronous in that I will get to it later.

## [SMS](./sms.md)

SMS / Text should be used in the even that you cannot find me on slack
and you have a semi-urgent question about something not on fire.

## [Phone call](./phone.md)

Phone calls should be used sparingly and normally scheduled in advance.
If you are calling me unscheduled it means something is on fire and
needs to be put out immediately.
