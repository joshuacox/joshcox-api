These are the human interactive methods of accessing Josh Cox.

## Human Interaction

Human Interaction is for pleasantries, don't get me wrong I love
hearing about whatever cool thing you saw discovered. But if what we are
going to be talking about pertains to work to be done it might be more
appropriate to choose one of the methods below.  Also, if I am wearing
headphones it is greatly preferred that you try one of the other methods
instead.

My first method exposes how to say good mornig to Josh in various languages.

{% sample lang="js" %}
Here is how to greet Josh in the morning in javascript:

```js
console.log('In the morning!');
```

{% sample lang="go" %}
And in go:

```go
fmt.Println("In the morning!")
```

{% sample lang="bash" %}
And in bash:

```bash
echo 'In the morning!'
```

{% sample lang="english" %}
And in english:

```english
say 'In the morning!'
```

{% sample lang="hashtag" %}
And with a shorthand hashtag:

```hashtag
#ITM
```

{% endmethod %}

Whatever language you are using, the result will be the same.
