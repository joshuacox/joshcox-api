### Issue creation

My first method exposes how to make an issue in Jira for Josh Cox

Create an issue in Jira and assign it to me. At which point I'll comment
and we can start a discussion about this topic.  Once the issue is fully
vetted technically then we will place it in a sprint and I'll actively
work on it.
