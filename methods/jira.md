### Issue creation

My first method exposes how to make an issue in Jira for Josh Cox

{% sample lang="jira" %}
Create an issue in Jira and assign it to me. At which point I'll comment
and we can start a discussion about this topic.  Once the issue is fully
vetted technically then we will place it in a sprint and I'll actively
work on it.

{% endmethod %}
