These are the Github issues methods of accessing Josh Cox.

Github issues are for publicly identifying bugs and/or issues that need
to be worked on by the transmute team.

{% method %}
## Github issues

My first method exposes how to create a github issue.

{% sample lang="manual" %}
### Github manual issue creation
Github has a guide on this [topic](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

{% sample lang="hub" %}
### Github/hub CLI issue creation
[Github/hub](https://github.com/github/hub) is a CLI tool that can aid in this.  e.g.

Here is how to create an isue for  Josh using `hub`:
```
hub issue create -a joshuacox -m 'my issue'
```
^ will create an issue in the repo related to your current working
directory and assign it to me.
