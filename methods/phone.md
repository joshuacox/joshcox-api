## Phone

Phone calls should be used sparingly and normally scheduled in advance.
If you are calling me unscheduled it means something is on fire and
needs to be put out immediately.

### Call josh

My first method exposes how to call Josh and say "In the morning!"

1. dial my number
1. wait for the ringing to stop and me to pick up the phone and say 'Moshi Moshi'
1. Announce your #ITM, "In the morning!"
